The exchange positions itself as a beginner-friendly platform that reduces friction for new crypto traders by combining automated tools and community-driven features. BingX operates under regulatory frameworks including FCIS (Lithuania) and AUSTRAC (Australia), though it does not currently hold licenses from major tier-1 jurisdictions like the US or UK.
